## How does it work?

It's quite simple:

1. Go to the fonts [folder](https://github.com/ManucrackYT/FontChanger/tree/main/fonts/) and select the font you want to install
2. Download the files (.tff and .reg) and place them in your Desktop
3. Double click the .tff file and a window will open, click the Install button to save the font into your system
4. Now double click the .reg file and Accept to perform administrator actions in Registry Editor
5. Accept to modify values and restart your computer
6. The font is now installed and ready to be used!
